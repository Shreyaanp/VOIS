2023-11-26 01:34:50,872 - System: Well, as a student, I'm pretty much always connected to the internet. Whether it's for studying, research, or simply staying in touch with friends, I rely on a stable and reliable internet connection.

You'll have to give your basic information such as address, phone number and your Aadhar card information. And then you wait for three days and I pay 150.
